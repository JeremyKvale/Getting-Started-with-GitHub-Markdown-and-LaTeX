# Rigid Pendulum Driven by a Pivot Point
This is a repository containing information and responses regarding a rigid pendulum contained by a pivot point that is being driven up and down. Additionally, this repository contains basic Markdown and LaTeX elements.

## How do you expect the rigid pendulum will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency ($\omega_0 = \sqrt{g/L}$) of the pendulum (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?





## If the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?





If we start the pendulum oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior?
